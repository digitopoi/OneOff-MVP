# OneOff

## Goal

OneOff's (future) goal is to connect small to mid-sized traveling musicians with venues. If an artist has a Saturday show in Chicago on Sunday and a show in Indianapolis on Thursday, they might be interested in finding an extra gig in between on a Tuesday or Wednesday night. Venues would be interested in adding some music on a slower Tuesday night. 

## Directions to Run

1. Clone the Repo. 

2. Check to make sure that the OneOff.Web.MVC app is the startup project. 

3. Run the app and register a new account.

4. Add dates to your "calendar"
